To assist you with setting up the Flask API for emotion detection and enabling integration with your friend's mobile app, I will break down all the necessary steps, including detailed explanations and all the points you need to follow. This will help you share the details with your friend and ensure everything works smoothly.

### **Step-by-Step Guide to Set Up the Flask API**

This guide will explain how to create a Flask API for emotion detection, integrate it with a mobile app, and deploy it for production use.

### **Step 1: Setup Flask API for Emotion Detection**

This step involves setting up the Flask API, loading the pre-trained emotion detection model, and ensuring the model returns the required data efficiently.

#### **1.1 Install Required Libraries**
You will need to install the following libraries:

```bash
pip install flask tensorflow opencv-python numpy
```

These libraries include:
- `Flask`: To create the web API.
- `TensorFlow`: To load and run the emotion detection model.
- `OpenCV`: For face detection and image processing.
- `NumPy`: For array operations.

#### **1.2 Load Pre-trained Emotion Detection Model**

Make sure you have a pre-trained emotion detection model (e.g., a Keras `.h5` model). If you don't have one, you may need to train one, but for now, we assume you have the trained model.

#### **1.3 Create the Flask API (`app.py`)**

This file will define the endpoints for emotion detection. The endpoint `/detect_emotion` will receive image data, process it, and return detected emotions.

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
import cv2
import numpy as np
from tensorflow.keras.models import load_model
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.image import img_to_array

# Initialize Flask app
app = Flask(__name__)

# Load emotion detection model (update the path to your actual model file)
emotion_model = load_model('path_to_your_model.h5')  # Update the path

# Define emotion labels (these should match the model's training)
emotion_labels = ['Angry', 'Disgust', 'Fear', 'Happy', 'Sad', 'Surprise', 'Neutral']
face_detector = cv2.CascadeClassifier(cv2.data.haarcascades + 'haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml')

@app.route('/detect_emotion', methods=['POST'])
def detect_emotion():
    try:
        # Receive image as base64 encoded string from the request
        data = request.get_json()
        image_data = np.array(data['image'], dtype=np.uint8)
        frame = cv2.imdecode(image_data, cv2.IMREAD_COLOR)  # Decode the image

        # Convert to grayscale
        gray = cv2.cvtColor(frame, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)
        faces = face_detector.detectMultiScale(gray, scaleFactor=1.3, minNeighbors=5)

        detected_emotions = []

        for (x, y, w, h) in faces:
            roi = gray[y:y+h, x:x+w]
            roi = cv2.resize(roi, (48, 48))  # Resize to model's input shape (48x48)
            roi = roi.astype("float") / 255.0  # Normalize
            roi = img_to_array(roi)  # Convert to array
            roi = np.expand_dims(roi, axis=0)  # Add batch dimension

            # Predict emotion
            predictions = emotion_model.predict(roi, verbose=0)[0]
            label = emotion_labels[np.argmax(predictions)]  # Get label with the highest probability
            confidence = round(np.max(predictions), 2)  # Get confidence level

            # Append result to response
            detected_emotions.append({
                "emotion": label,
                "confidence": float(confidence),
                "box": [int(x), int(y), int(w), int(h)]  # Bounding box for face
            })

        # Return the detected emotions as a JSON response
        return jsonify({
            "status": "success",
            "emotions": detected_emotions
        }), 200

    except Exception as e:
        return jsonify({
            "status": "error",
            "message": str(e)
        }), 500


if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True, host='0.0.0.0', port=5000)  # Flask server running on port 5000
```

#### **Explanation of Flask API**:
1. **Emotion Model Loading**: The `load_model()` function loads a pre-trained emotion detection model.
2. **Face Detection**: We use OpenCV's pre-trained Haar Cascade Classifier to detect faces in the input image.
3. **Emotion Prediction**: Once a face is detected, the image is resized and preprocessed for prediction. The model returns the predicted emotion with a confidence score.
4. **Response Format**: The API returns a JSON object with the detected emotion, confidence level, and the bounding box around the face.
5. **Error Handling**: The `try`/`except` block ensures that if something goes wrong (like invalid data), a useful error message is returned.

### **Step 2: Mobile App Integration (Sending Requests)**

Once the Flask API is set up, your friend's mobile app will need to send a request to this API to receive the emotion detection results.

Here is an example of how to do this in **Node.js** or **React Native** (with **Axios** for HTTP requests).

#### **2.1 Example of Sending a Request from the Mobile App (Node.js)**:

```javascript
const axios = require('axios');

// Assuming the image is in base64 format
const imageBase64 = "BASE64_ENCODED_IMAGE_HERE";  // Replace with actual base64 image string

axios.post('http://localhost:5000/detect_emotion', {
    image: imageBase64  // Send the image as base64
})
.then(response => {
    if (response.data.status === "success") {
        // Handle emotions returned by the API
        console.log("Detected emotions:", response.data.emotions);
    } else {
        console.error("Error:", response.data.message);
    }
})
.catch(error => {
    console.error("API Request Error:", error);
});
```

#### **2.2 Mobile App Receives the Response**

The response from the API will look like this:

```json
{
    "status": "success",
    "emotions": [
        {
            "emotion": "Happy",
            "confidence": 0.95,
            "box": [100, 150, 80, 80]
        },
        {
            "emotion": "Sad",
            "confidence": 0.85,
            "box": [300, 400, 100, 100]
        }
    ]
}
```

- The `emotion` field contains the label (e.g., "Happy", "Sad").
- The `confidence` field gives the probability of the detected emotion.
- The `box` field provides the bounding box coordinates around the detected face in the form `[x, y, width, height]`.

This data can be processed and displayed by the mobile app (e.g., show the emotion label and bounding box on the screen).

### **Step 3: Deploy the Flask API**

Once everything is set up, you will need to deploy the Flask app so it is accessible over the internet. Hereâ€™s how you can do it on **Heroku** (which is simple and free for small projects).

#### **3.1 Deploying Flask on Heroku**

1. **Install Heroku CLI** (if you don't have it installed already):
   - [Heroku CLI Installation](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli)

2. **Create `Procfile`**:
   A `Procfile` is required to tell Heroku how to run your app. Create this file in your project root:

   ```
   web: python app.py
   ```

3. **Initialize Git Repository**:
   If you haven't initialized Git in your project yet, do so now:

   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   ```

4. **Deploy to Heroku**:
   - Log in to Heroku:
     ```bash
     heroku login
     ```

   - Create a Heroku app:
     ```bash
     heroku create
     ```

   - Push the code to Heroku:
     ```bash
     git push heroku master
     ```

5. **Open the App**:
   Once deployed, you will receive a Heroku URL where your app is hosted (e.g., `https://your-app-name.herokuapp.com`).

   Your mobile app can now send requests to this URL for emotion detection.

---

### **Step 4: Testing and Optimizing**

- **Testing**: Test your API locally and on Heroku to ensure everything works as expected. Use **Postman** or **curl** to simulate requests and responses.
  
- **Optimization**:
  - **Model Optimization**: Consider optimizing your model using **TensorFlow Lite** or **ONNX** if you need faster inference or if you plan to deploy the model to mobile devices.
  - **Caching**: Implement caching if you expect the same image to be uploaded multiple times (e.g., using Redis).
  - **Error Handling**: Ensure the mobile app handles errors gracefully when the API is unavailable or encounters an issue.
